            <p>The illustrator of <ref target="#bib:Hardy1874_FarFromTheMaddingCrowd">far from the
                  Madding Crowd</ref> began as a charming young lady, <persName
                  ref="#ps:HelenAllingham">Miss Helen Paterson</persName>, and ended as a married
               woman â€“ charms unknown- wife of <persName ref="#ps:WilliamAllingham"
                  >Allingham</persName> the poet. I have never set eyes on her since she was the
               former and I met her and corresponded with her about the pictures of the story. She
               was the best illustrator I ever had. She and I were married about the same time in
               the progress of our mutual work but not to each other, which I fear rather spoils the
               information. Though I have never thought of her for the last 20 years your inquiry
               makes me feel "quite romantical" about her (as they say here), and as she is a
                  <placeName ref="#pl:London">London</placeName> artist, well known as <persName
                  ref="#ps:HelenAllingham">Mrs
               A.</persName><!--Link to Helen Allingham not working in Exist--> you might hunt her
               up, and tell me what she <subst><del><gap/></del><add place="inline" rend="black-pen"
                     >look</add></subst>s like as an elderly <del rend="stikethrough">widow</del>
               woman. If you do, please give her my kind regards, but you must not add that those
               two almost simultaneous weddings would have been one but for a stupid blunder of God
               Almighty.</p>

            <p>Why did you go wasting your money on that first edition! I could have sent you the
               last edition, much more correct, the first not having been corrected by me, but
               hurriedly set up from the magazine by the publisher.</p>

            <p>I am trying to enter into Part III of the <ref
                  target="#bib:Hardy1904-1908_TheDynasts">Dynasts</ref>. I am so sorry to learn that
                  <persName ref="#ps:EllenGosse">Mrs Gosse</persName> is a prisoner still. Do you
               think that if you could get her to the sea she would recover?</p>

            <p>All I have heard more about <persName ref="#ps:MarieMeredith">Mrs
                  <abbr>S.</abbr></persName> is what <persName ref="#ps:FrederickMacmillan"

                     <expan>Frederick</expan></choice> Macmillan</persName> told me the day before I
               left town. He said that the <choice><sic>story (like</sic><corr>story
                  (like</corr></choice> that of the death of <persName ref="#ps:MarkTwain">Mark
                  Twain</persName>) had been much exaggerated. The pair have for some time been
               unable to get on well together (Her fault, I should say) and she has therefore taken
               a flat in <placeName ref="#pl:London">London</placeName> as a bachelor woman, which
               she comes up to for the week, going down to <placeName ref="#pl:Leatherhead"
                  >Leatherhead</placeName>, their home, from Sat. to Mon. The "Italian Count" has
               vanished from the narrative. I hope I may see you some time in the Autumn.</p>
