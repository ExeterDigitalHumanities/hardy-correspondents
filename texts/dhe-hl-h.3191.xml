            </opener>

            <p>Thank you for <choice><abbr>y<hi rend="superscript"
                  >r</hi>.</abbr><expan>your</expan></choice> cheerful &amp; pleasant letter – &amp;
               also for the kindness in telling me of another <placeName ref="#pl:Weymouth"
                  >Weymouth</placeName> Hotel. But alas! my finances won't allow of anything so
               pleasant <hi rend="underline">now</hi> as a visit to your lovely coast, or
               motor-drives round <placeName ref="#pl:Wessex">Wessex</placeName> with you &amp;
                  <persName ref="#ps:FlorenceHardy">F</persName>. –</p>

            <p>I have, as yet, failed to sell my house, owing, I suppose to the depressing &amp;
               universal "slump" <pb n="2" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3191_2.jpg"/> which has overtaken us -
               But I do hope that in a short time the outlook may be brighter – I wish you

                  <expan>would</expan></choice> both come to <placeName ref="#pl:London"
                  >London</placeName> for a few days when this very dry weather comes to an end, as
               I suppose it must soon. The park is like cocoa-nut matting, &amp; I fear our beloved
               birds are having a bad time. –</p>

            <pb n="3" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3191_3.jpg"/>

            <p>How amusing your <hi rend="underline">Film</hi> experiences must have been! It seems
               marvellous to complete a whole book in one day. I don't suppose the film-actor can be
               a person of very high calibre, as a rule ? – <hi rend="underline">I</hi> shall never
               become a frequenter of the "movies", as I think them so bad for the eyes. –</p>

            <p>I am glad you have had some agreeable visitors. <persName ref="#ps:WalterdelaMare"
                     >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De La Mare</persName> struck me as very
               pleasant, unspoilt &amp; simple, &amp; I admire some of his work greatly, as I
               daresay you do? – I am sure you are very kind to the young <pb n="4"
                  facs="uoedh_hl_h.3191_4.jpg"/> Georgians. <persName ref="#ps:WalterdelaMare">De La
                  M.</persName> is, however, on a different footing, isn't he? from most of
               them.</p>

            <p>I went to the <persName ref="#ps:EdmundGosse">Gosses</persName> last Sunday. He was
               in excellent spirits, &amp; youthful as ever – Of course we talked about you. I met
               there 3 of the typical young Poets, who signed the address to you – A brother &amp;
               sister – she with an <hi rend="underline">extraordinary</hi> hat, like a bad specimen
               of – shall we say, Gothic architecture (-<add place="above">the</add>
               <persName ref="#ps:EdithSitwell">Sitwells</persName>–) I think she wrote in a
               detestable little book called "Wheels.".</p>


            <p>By the way, they were not <hi rend="underline">all</hi> very young <pb n="5"
                  facs="uoedh_hl_h.3191_5.jpg"/>
               <milestone xml:id="m01" unit="section"/>
               <milestone xml:id="m02" unit="section"/> authors who signed the document –! –</p>


            <p>I have just finished a book, translated from the Italian of <persName
                  ref="#ps:GuglielmoFerrero">Ferrero</persName> called "Ancient Rome &amp; Modern
               America"– It gives one a good deal to think about, &amp; some of it
                        <choice><abbr>w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>.</abbr>
                  <expan>would</expan></choice> interest you, perhaps–? –</p>

            <p>Did you hear of the stroke of dreadfully bad luck which 3. of the poets, including
                  <persName ref="#ps:WalterdelaMare">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> de la
                  Mare</persName> have had? It appears <pb n="6" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3191_6.jpg"/> that
               they were each given a sum of money from the sale of <persName ref="#ps:RupertBrooke"
                  >Rupert Brooke</persName>'s works, – &amp; <hi rend="underline">now</hi>, after a
               lapse of some years, it is discovered that the income-tax was not paid! It seems <hi
                  rend="underline">cruelly</hi> hard to come down on these men for some hundreds of
               pounds, which they certainly could not <pb n="7" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3191_7.jpg"/> pay
               except with the <hi rend="underline">greatest</hi> difficulty &amp; worry.</p>

            <p>My sister-in-law is quite well again, thanks – &amp; I daresay an enforced rest
               really did her good–</p>

            <p>I remember thinking <persName ref="#ps:MrJeune">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                  Jeune</persName>, <!--possible relative of Lady St Helier?--> whom I met at tea
               with you, very pleasant company. I hope he is better.</p>

            <p>I hope some day to meet <pb n="8" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3191_8.jpg"/> the <persName
                  ref="#ps:JohnGalsworthy">Galsworthys</persName>. Do you think he would find me too
               dully respectable?–</p>

            <p>I wonder if this craze for prize-fights &amp; games is a sign of great decadence? But
               the Press seems to have no sense of proportion – There was more fuss and larger
               headlines on the death of <persName ref="#ps:JeanetteChurchill"
