               <salute>Thomas Hardy,</salute>
               <salute>My dear sir:</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I have just finished reading <ref target="#bib:Hardy1891_Tess">Tess</ref>--strange
               that I never read it before. Next to <ref target="#bib:Hardy1894_JudetheObscure"
                  >Jude</ref>, it is the most tremendous thing I have ever read. To me you are like
               some <hi rend="underline">terrible old prophet</hi> crying in the wilderness. The two
               books have been my baptism of fire. I do not pretend to be a critic, but to me you
               are the greatest mind that has worked in English fiction. It is useless to compare
               you with other writers, though, for you are so totally unlike them. It is so easy and
               so tempting to make a book popular by evading the truth--to present life
                     <choice><sic>asa</sic><corr>as a</corr></choice> gilded puppet, rather than in
               its native dignity and--yes, I think so, on the whole--sorrow.</p>

            <p>But to me you are no pessimist. Your belief in human nature is the most profound,
               unquenchable, of any man's I have ever known in per- <pb n="2"
                  facs="uoedh_hl_h.2035_2.jpg"/>
               <pb n="3" facs="uoedh_hl_h.2035_3.jpg"/> son or through books. Your insight into the
               heart of woman is the most Christ-like of anything I have ever met in literature. The
               senseless, untrue, and too often malignant criticisms that have been passed upon you
               in this connection are enough to make one despise the reviewing system which can
               permit such a travesty on justice. If I had a daughter unfolding into womanhood, I
               should certainly place <ref target="#bib:Hardy1891_Tess">Tess</ref> and <ref
                  target="#bib:Hardy1894_JudetheObscure">Jude</ref> in her hands, and feel that I
               had provided the instruction which most mothers are too cowed by convention to
               give.</p>

            <p>Although I am an American (Canadian born), yet I have lived some time in <placeName
                  ref="#pl:England">England</placeName>--mostly in <placeName ref="#pl:Kent"
                  >Kent</placeName> and <placeName ref="#pl:Essex">Essex</placeName>, and feel that
               you have made your characters an inseparable part of, the inevitable product of,
               their environment. Perhaps from the literary standpoint I can pay you no higher
               compliment.</p>

            <p>But to me you are much more than a great novelist. To use a much abused phrase, you
               are a man with a mission--the deliverance of woman from the heaviest shackles that a
               stupid and selfish society has forged for her.</p>

            <pb n="5" facs="uoedh_hl_h.2035_5.jpg"/>

            <p>Now I know that you will take these crudities in the spirit in which they are
               written--a deep desire to express my appreciation of the man who to me is the most
               significant figure in modern literature.</p>
