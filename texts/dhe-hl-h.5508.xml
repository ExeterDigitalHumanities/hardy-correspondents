               <salute>My dear Mr Hardy,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I have read the new instalments of the <ref
                  target="#bib:Hardy1874_FarFromTheMaddingCrowd">Madding Crowd</ref> with great
               pleasure - I think the story grows in interest &amp; is equally vigorous in
               description. You need not be afraid of <gap reason="tearing"/></p>
            <!--check if correct-->

            <pb n="2" facs="uoedh_hl_h.5508_2.jpg"/>

            <p> part of the story; <abbr>Wh.</abbr>, however, must be prefaced by the general remark
               that <del>all</del> I object as editor, not as critic, ie. in the interest of a
               stupid public, not from my own taste.</p>

            <p>I think that the reference to the cause of <persName ref="#ps:FannyRobin"
                  >Fanny</persName>'s death is unnecessarily emphasized. I should, I think, omit all
               reference to it except just enough to indicate the true state of the case; &amp;
               especially a conversation between your heroine &amp; her maid,
                     <choice><abbr>wh.</abbr><expan>which</expan></choice> is a little unpleasant. I
               have some doubts whether the baby is necessary at all &amp; whether it would not be
               sufficient for <persName ref="#ps:BathshebaEverdene">Bathsheba</persName> to open the
               coffin in order to identify the dead woman with the person she
                  <unclear>meets</unclear> on the road. This is a point
                     <choice><abbr>wh.</abbr><expan>which</expan></choice> you can consider. It
               certainly rather injures the story,
                     <del><choice><abbr>wh.</abbr><expan>which</expan></choice></del> &amp; perhaps
               if the omission were made it might be restored on republication. But I am rather
                  <unclear reason="illegible">necessarily</unclear> anxious to be on the safe side;
               and should somehow be glad to omit the baby.</p>

            <p>However, these changes can be easily made when the story is in type &amp; I shall
               send it to the printers now; &amp; ask you to do what is necessary to the proofs.</p>
