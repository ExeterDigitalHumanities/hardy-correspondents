               <salute>My Dear Thomas Hardy:</salute>
            </opener>

            <p> Of course your last <del><unclear>let</unclear></del> note does not, did not require
               an answer — any more than my rather bold envoi of books needed acknowledgement — only
               it is so exceedingly difficult to get any criticism whatever <add place="above"> from
                  anyone whose reaction one respects</add> – there is the malice engendered – by
               stupidity – to the hurried hack work of poor devils who have had to write reviews —
               <!-- longer than an emdash? --> that if you have by any chance looked at the wretched
               brochures again and found any specific merit or demerit, it would be <pb n="2"
                  facs="uoedh_hl_h.4816_2.jpg"/>
               <pb n="3" facs="uoedh_hl_h.4816_3.jpg"/> no inconsiderable kindness to send
                  <unclear>me</unclear> word. — not a politeness – </p>
            <p>The <name type="poem">Propertius</name> is confused. – <name type="poem">
                  Mauberley</name> is <unclear>thin</unclear> – but one tries to comfort oneself
               with the argument that the qualities are inherent in the subject matter. – –</p>
            <p>It is perhaps very " <subst>
                  <del><unclear>non</unclear></del>
                  <add place="above">un-</add></subst> English" to regard literature as a "mystery",
               a druidic <note rend="pencil" hand="other">druidic</note> guild, in which one
               receives at least a few orders &amp; a few prohibitions from the generation <note
                  rend="pencil" hand="other">generation</note> of elders.</p>
            <p>I recognise the fact that the stuff in question may have the supreme fault of being
               'merely uninteresting' — in which case no criticism is possible – &amp; there is no
               remedy but the <add place="above">slender</add> chance of doing better next time. </p>

            <p>I don't know that I have any other excuse to offer for writing this note. I was very
               much surprised <subst>
                  <del>by your first letter</del>
                  <add place="inline">that you had heard of me at all</add></subst> — as indicated
               in your first reply to my importunities on behalf of the <orgName ref="#ps:TheDial"
                  >Dial</orgName>.</p>
            <p>I don't think mere praise is any good — I know where I can get it, &amp; just what
                  <hi rend="underline">wrong</hi> reasons will lead one or two eminent
               contemporaries to like or tolerate certain passages. – </p>

            <p>Forgive me if I blurt out this demand for more frankness than anything, save perhaps
               a lifelong friendship, can engender between two individuals.</p>
