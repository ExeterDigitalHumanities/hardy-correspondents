               <salute>My dear Sir</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Thank you very much for your kind &amp; patient answer to my letters – it was a
               relief – for after I sent it (I observe you say a woman always feels this - the
               remark is in <ref target="#bib:Hardy1871_Remedies">Desperate Remedies</ref>
               <choice>
                  <abbr>wh:</abbr>
                  <expan>which</expan>
               </choice> we have been reading since I wrote) I felt sorry – it seemed rather
               presumptuous in <hi rend="underline">me</hi> to find fault with <hi rend="underline"
                  >you</hi> -</p>
            <p>I began to write only meaning to send our thanks – not <pb n="2"
                  facs="uoedh_hl_h.4152_2.jpg"/> criticism &amp; then this idea
                     <choice><abbr>wh:</abbr><expan>which</expan></choice> I confess had been some
               time latent got into words.</p>

            <p>I feel now too late that it was ungrateful to find fault with <persName
                  ref="#ps:BathshebaEverdene">Bathsheba</persName> who must have cost you infinite
               time &amp; labour to create – She is almost always true to herself but then her
               nature is such that of a true woman – because she is centred on self.</p>

            <p>You have not understood me – I quite agree that the ordinary type of woman
                        <choice><abbr>sh<hi rend="superscript"
                  >d</hi></abbr><expan>should</expan></choice> not be idealised into a book heroine
               -</p>

            <p>I have not time now to discuss what you say of <del><unclear>the</unclear></del>
               women of real life – but I fancy we are not agreed thereon -</p>

            <p>But your letter shows that you hold as we do that the novelist's kingdom is something
               much greater than the "public" <subst><del>need</del><add place="above">idea of
                     it</add></subst> &amp; therefore I feel courage to speak without fear of
               ridicule –</p>

            <p>I have tried to paint a good woman <pb n="3" facs="uoedh_hl_h.4152_3.jpg"/> &amp; I
               know I have failed – but when I think of <persName ref="#ps:Cordelia"
                  >Cordelia</persName> I know it can be done – <persName ref="#ps:DorotheaBrooke"
                  >Dorothea Brooke</persName> &amp; <persName ref="#ps:DinahMorris">Dinah
                  Morris</persName> are not what I mean – they are too superhuman – <persName
                  ref="#ps:DorotheaBrooke">Dorothea</persName> is a pure faultless pagan – &amp;
                  <persName ref="#ps:DinahMorris">Dinah</persName> is too much of a female Priest –
                  <persName ref="#ps:ElizabethGaskell">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
                  Gaskell</persName>'s <persName ref="#ps:MollyGibson">Molly</persName> comes nearer
               to poor humanity, but I fancy a dash of sauciness or even of naughtiness would much
               improve <persName ref="#ps:MollyGibson">Molly</persName> - for I think true art never
               outsteps nature – </p>
            <p> Last night just as your letter came – my <subst><del><gap/></del><add
                     place="superimposed">h</add></subst>usband read aloud a sentence from November

               dissatisfaction with your <pb n="4" facs="uoedh_hl_h.4152_4.jpg"/> heroines – If men
               like to believe this axiom as regards themselves – they may but I am sure it is false
               as regards women – that is women who recognise duty as a principle &amp; <persName
                  ref="#ps:BathshebaEverdene">Bathsheba</persName> does this– I do not want a
               heroine to be very clever – but I want her to have a soul
                     <choice><abbr>wh:</abbr><expan>which</expan></choice> is not entirely governed

               </subst> a heroine must have beauty – Even in life a woman seems to miss her vocation
               who has not some special charm &amp; is rarely less vain if she have it not- but she
               need not think only about <hi rend="underline">men</hi> – if she loves – then she
               cannot love too well – but she will love just as intensely – just as ardently- if she
               is simple &amp; pure-minded &amp; <pb n="5" facs="uoedh_hl_h.4152_5.jpg"/> noble

            <p>This is no answer to your letter – I cannot write an answer without getting into
               Chapters – do not be alarmed at the length of this letter – I <add place="above"
