            <p>I have just been reading <ref target="#bib:Hardy1891_Tess">Tess of the
                  D'Urbervilles</ref> and was extremely interested in it, having stayed at
                  <placeName ref="#pl:BereRegis">Bere Regis</placeName>, especially in your
               reference to the family Ghost (if I may call it so) of the coach four</p>

            <p>It recalled to my mind an episode which puzzled me much at the time. Some years ago
               my brother-in-law, a <placeName ref="#pl:London">London</placeName> Clergyman, took
               duty at <placeName ref="#pl:BereRegis">Bere Regis</placeName> for the summer
               holidays. <pb n="2" facs="uoedh_hl_h.4600_2.jpg"/> I went with my sister to keep her
               company during the four or five weeks she was there. We were of course in the quaint
               old Vicarage. I had a front room, &amp; the weather being hot, had my window wide
               open.</p>

            <p>One night, about midnight, I was lying half awake and half asleep when it suddenly
               dawned on me that a coach was approaching, I heard the horn blowing &amp; the
               galloping of the horses. As it approached nearer the shouting &amp; clatter grew
               tremendously, &amp; from first thinking nothing of it, I grew annoyed with the <pb
                  n="3" facs="uoedh_hl_h.4600_3.jpg"/> stupendous noise it was making: I thought
               what a shame in a quiet village, that anyone should be allowed to drive through in
               such a wild way, as I felt sure it would arouse every inmate. Just when it was at its
               worst, it suddenly died away. I sprang out of bed, &amp; went to the window expecting
               that it had stopped in the village, &amp; that there would be the talking &amp;
               hurrying away of a few passengers. There was absolute stillness, no sound whatever,
               &amp; after listening for some time, I returned to bed, wondering if <pb n="4"
                  facs="uoedh_hl_h.4600_4.jpg"/> the coach had proceeded down another road, where
               the declivity had suddenly cut off the sound. – I couldn't make it out at all, but
               expected next day would clear the matter
                  up<choice><sic>.</sic><corr>,</corr></choice> as a coach arriving or passing
               though, with so much noise, I thought, would have caused a sensation in so small a
               village.</p>

            <p>However, next day, <abbr>tho'</abbr> I men­tioned it to several people, &amp; the
               country people themselves, nobody knew anything about it or would admit that a coach
               came through at night. For several nights I listened <pb n="5"
                  facs="uoedh_hl_h.4600_5.jpg"/> about midnight, in the expect­ation of hearing it
               again, but I never did so - now do you think I heard the phantom coach?</p>



            <p>It really looks like it, <abbr>tho'</abbr> in that case, how should I a north-country
               lady, &amp; having so far as I know, nothing, <unclear> &amp; no forbears</unclear>,
               with any connection with the south-country or <placeName ref="#pl:Dorset"
                  >Dorsetshire</placeName>, hear the
                     <choice><sic>D'urberville</sic><corr>d'Urberville</corr></choice> coach?</p>

            <p>In one thing I can corro­borate the hearing of it as bringing bad luck. I date
                  <unclear>from</unclear> the following year, two <pb n="6"
                  facs="uoedh_hl_h.4600_6.jpg"/> events which had a disastrous effect on my life,
               &amp; from the effects of which I have not yet recovered - I put down to those things
               all the ill-luck I have suffered from for years. But perhaps I ought to now attribute
               it to the Phantom Coach?!</p>

            <p>Hoping this may interest you, and thanking you very much for the pleasure you have
               given me in your books.</p>
