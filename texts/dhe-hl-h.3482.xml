               <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I think you have chosen well for the May illustration – certainly the incident after
               the mumming, with the mummers looking on, will be better than the mumming performance
               itself. <persName ref="#ps:EustaciaVye">Eustacia</persName> in boy's clothes, though
               pleasant enough to the imagination, would perhaps be unsafe as a picture. The sketch
               of a mummer's dress which I sent was merely intended to show the general system on
               which they used to decorate themselves: the surcoat or tunic was formed of a white
               smockfrock rather shorter than usual, tied in round the waist by a <pb n="2"
                  facs="uoedh_hl_h.3482_2.jpg"/> strap – this was almost invariably the groundwork
               of the costume: thus.</p>

            <!-- Three illustrations here with annotations below -->
            <figure>
               <figDesc>Sketch of an original smock</figDesc>
               <p>original smockf<hi rend="superscript">k</hi>.</p>
            </figure>
            <figure>
               <figDesc>Sketch of a smock tied in.</figDesc>
               <p>same tied in</p>
            </figure>
            <figure>
               <figDesc>Sketch of a smock decorated with ribbon.</figDesc>
               <p>same decorated with ribbon</p>
            </figure>


            <p>The figure in these sketches is however too short, except the third. The helmet was
               made of pasteboard, &amp; was much like one of those articles called "tea-cosys"
               which people use now a days for keeping the tea-pot warm, <figure place="inline"
                     ><figDesc>Sketch of the helmet</figDesc></figure> with a tuft at the top. The
               sword was wood, of course, &amp; the <hi rend="underline">staff</hi>, which was never
               dispensed with, consisted of a straight stick the size of a broom handle, 5 or 6 feet
               long, with small sticks inserted cross wise at the <pb n="3"
                  facs="uoedh_hl_h.3482_3.jpg"/> upper end: from the end of these small sticks paper
               tassels dangled. <figure><figDesc>Sketch of staff which appears next to the writing
                     on left side of the page</figDesc><p>Mummer's staff or spear</p></figure> This
               was held erect in the left hand while the sword was brandished in the right. Father
               Christmas was a conventional figure – an old man with a humpback, &amp; a great
               club.</p>
            <p>I should prefer to leave <persName ref="#ps:ClymYeobright">Clym</persName>'s face
               entirely to you. A thoughtful young man of 25 is all that can be shown, as the
               particulars of his appearance given in the story are too minute to be represented in
               a small drawing.</p>

            <p>A mummer or two in the <del>corner of the </del> picture would make it very
               interesting – but do not be at all hampered by my suggestions <pb n="4"
                  facs="uoedh_hl_h.3482_4.jpg"/> for I may attach an undue importance to the
               mummers. </p>
