               <salute>Dear Mr Hardy,</salute>
            </opener>


            <p> As one who had the pleasure of meeting you here at <placeName
                  ref="#pl:MagdaleneCambridge">Magdalene College</placeName>, I am venturing to
               write to you on a subject which has always been of interest to me, and which forms a
               striking incident in the '<ref target="#bib:Hardy1886_Mayor">Mayor of
                  Casterbridge</ref>'. The incident there related of the sale of the wife is I
               believe authentic to judge from your Preface. It is a curious fact that Marcellus,
               the Chargé d'Affaires of France records the sale of wives at <placeName
                  ref="#pl:SmithfieldMarket">Smithfield</placeName> in 1823. I find two incidents
               confirming this in the contemporary press, but I have not come across the instance
               you mention. I am proposing to make a short communication to the second number of the
                  <orgName ref="CambridgeHistoricalJournal"><hi rend="italics">Cambridge Historical
                     Journal</hi></orgName> on this subject, and I should be very grateful if you
               could give me any information as to the case you yourself mention. In case you have
               not seen the first number, I enclose a copy. You will see the table of contents on
               the last page of the cover, and it would go in as a note and communication.</p>

            <p> Apologising for troubling you on a subject which you have made more interesting and
               well-known than would otherwise have been the case and which is in any circumstances
               of considerable social interest.</p>

            <closer>
               <salute>I remain, with the greatest respect,</salute>
               <salute>Yours very truly,</salute>

            <opener>Dear Mr Temperley:</opener>
            <p>(Please pardon a dictated letter, on account of weakness of sight)</p>
            <p>In reply to your inquiry on the sale of a wife in <ref target="#bib:Hardy1886_Mayor"
                  >The Mayor of Casterbridge</ref>, alluded to in the preface to that tale as being
               based on fact. I can only say that in the eighteen twenties – a time assumed for the
               incident there were many wife-sales – as you may easily see by looking through a file
               of newspapers of that date. These sales had various features of detail, but how much
               either sale resembled that of the story in its details I am unable to remember. (the
               novel was written nearly 40 years ago.) I fancy a sailor was the purchaser in one of
               the true instances, but I am not quite sure. Many thanks for the Historical
               Journal.</p>
