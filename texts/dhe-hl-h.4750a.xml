            <p>Here is the story of <persName ref="#ps:MarthaBrown">Martha Brown</persName>, as I
               find it, still fresh in the memory of our older neighbours. It was very close to us
               as the site of where <persName ref="#ps:MarthaBrown">Martha</persName>'s cottage was
               can be seen from the room <pb n="2" facs="uoedh_hl_h.4750a_2.jpg"/> where you had
               tea. Though just in the Parish of <placeName ref="#pl:Broadwindsor"
                  >Broadwindsor</placeName> it is almost the furtherest point from the Village. Many
               of the cottages <damage agent="rust">have</damage> fallen down since &amp; not been
               rebuilt, <placeName ref="#pl:BirdsmoorGate">Birdsmore Gate</placeName>

                  <persName ref="#ps:JimLane">Lane</persName>, whose story I send, is one of the old

               <!-- has address and telegram info as a letterhead at top of page 3, encode as a figure? or use pointer? -->has
               not affected his generous outlook on life &amp; his simple moral code. He went out to
               work at 8. for 1/. a week, walking 2 or 3 miles to his work, married young &amp;
               buried his frail little wife a few months ago &amp; has been very lonesome since.
               They reared 13 children, &amp; one grandson, from a few days old, who makes a home
               for the old man now, in one of our cottages â€” <pb n="4" facs="uoedh_hl_h.4750a_4.jpg"
               /> He served us loyally, when we started farming in the War, &amp; was the man I
               spoke of, who insisted on the hand drawn reed, &amp; taught our children how to do
               it, in our ball crush.</p>
            <p>Some day, if I may, I will come &amp; have a talk over poor <persName
