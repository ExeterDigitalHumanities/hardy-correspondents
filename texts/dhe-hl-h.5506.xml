               <salute>My dear Mr Hardy,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I have read through your <abbr>MS</abbr> with very great pleasure; though I had seen
               most of it before. As you ask me for my opinion I will say frankly that I think the
               sheepshearing rather long for <subst>
                  <del>the</del>
                  <add place="superimposed">our</add>
               </subst> present purpose. When the novel appears as a whole, it may very well come in
               in <choice><sic>it's</sic><corr>its</corr></choice> present form. For periodical
               purposes, I think it rather delays the action unnecessarily. What I should be
               inclined to do would be simply to omit the chapter headed the "shearing supper" &amp;
               to add a few paragraphs to the succeeding and preceding, just explaining that there
               has been a supper. The chapter on the "Great Barn" &amp; that called "a merry time"
               seem to me to be excellent &amp; I would not omit <subst>
                  <del><unclear>either</unclear></del>
                  <add place="superimposed">them</add>
               </subst> or shorten them. The other seems to me the least good of the three - &amp;
                  <unclear>therefore</unclear> the best to abridge. I don't know whether anything
               turns on the <pb n="2" facs="uoedh_hl_h.5506_2.jpg"/> bailiff's story; but I don't
               think it necessary.</p>

            <p>I shall take the <abbr>MS</abbr> to <orgName ref="#ps:SmithElderCo">Smith &amp;
                  Elder</orgName>'s today &amp; will tell them that they will hear from you. Please
               write to them (to <orgName ref="#ps:SmithElderCo">S.E &amp; Co</orgName>
               <placeName ref="#pl:WaterlooPlace15">15 Waterloo Place <add place="below"> S.
                     W.</add></placeName>)<!--check add is correct--> &amp; say whether the whole is
               to be printed as it stands; or whether the chapter I mention is to be omitted; or
               whether you would like to have the <abbr>MS</abbr> again to alter previously to
               printing. Do whichever judgement commands.</p>

            <p>I have heard of the story from many people &amp; have only heard one opinion of its
               merits, <abbr>wh.</abbr> coincides with my own. As it goes on &amp; gets more into
               the action, I am sure that the opinion will be higher still. In short, I think you
               have every reason to be satisfied &amp; encouraged.</p>

            <p>
               <orgName ref="#ps:TheSpectator">The Spectator</orgName>'s instincts are better than
                     <choice><sic>it's</sic><corr>its</corr></choice> reasons. It generally
               recognises a good thing; but almost always talks nonsense about the causes of
                     <choice><sic>it's</sic><corr>its</corr></choice> admiration. As for the
               supposed affinity to <persName ref="#ps:GeorgeEliot">George Eliot</persName>, it
               consists, I think, simply in this that you have both treated rustics of the farming
               class in a humorous manner - <persName ref="#ps:RachelPoyser">Mrs Poyser</persName>
               would be at home I think, in <placeName ref="#pl:Weatherbury">Weatherbury</placeName>
               - but you need not be afraid of such criticisms. You are original <pb n="3"
                  facs="uoedh_hl_h.5506_3-4.jpg"/> &amp; can stand on your own legs.</p>

            <postscript>
               <p>I have said frankly what I thought; but I hope you will not attach too much
                  importance to my criticism - Do exactly what you think right - I shall be content.
