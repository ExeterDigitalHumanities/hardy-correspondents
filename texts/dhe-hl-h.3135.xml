               <salute>My dear friend:</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I had reserved my reply to your last kind letter till to-day, in order to make it a
               Christmas greeting, &amp; now I have a double impulse to write, having received the
               picture-card &amp; words on it this morning. It seems, so far as I can judge, a very
               pretty place, but I cannot tell the sub-soil from the view. However I hope it is dry,
               &amp; will suit you.</p>

            <p> The new Christmas does not <pb n="2" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3135_2.jpg"/> exhilarate me
               much. But of course I cannot expect it to. The worst of a sad event in middle life
               &amp; beyond is that one does not recover from the shock as in earlier years; so I
               simply say to myself of this Christmas, "Yet another!"</p>

            <p>The alliance with <orgName type="university" ref="#ps:UniversityofCambridge"
                  >Cambridge</orgName>, to which you allude, is pleasing: it gives me a fresh centre
               of interest, &amp; they are all such nice friends to me there. I am intending to
               visit it very often, but whether I shall is doubtful.</p>

            <pb n="3" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3135_3.jpg"/>

            <p>I read <persName ref="#ps:MillicentWedmore">Miss Wedmore</persName>'s poems, that you
               were good enough to send,
               <!-- there is a link to this collection of poems that could go in bib<ref target="https://archive.org/details/chieflyofheroesp00wedmiala">  -->
               &amp; liked best those you had marked, as was natural. The half-page of <orgName
                  type="newspaper" ref="#ps:TheSpehere">The Sphere</orgName> of this week, which I
               enclose as a sort of <choice><abbr>Xmas</abbr>
                  <expan>Christmas</expan></choice> card, gives a few verses I was asked for by the
               editor, but a periodical is a chilling atmosphere for poems: the mood induced by a
               newspaper is just the wrong one, &amp; puts them out of tune.</p>


            <p> Do you ever see a quarterly magazine called <orgName ref="#ps:PoetryandDrama"
                  type="periodical">"Poetry &amp; Drama"</orgName>. It is written by a group of
               young men whose idea of verse is that <pb n="4" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3135_4.jpg"/> nobody
               has ever known how to write it in the whole history of literature till they came
               along to show the trick to the world; so it is amusing reading, which I think you
               would like.</p>

            <p>A <persName ref="#ps:OliveEdis">young lady</persName> came this week to photograph me
               in colour, at the request of a friend of mine. The specimens she showed me were
               extraordinary in their reality. But I am getting tired of it all. My niece &amp;
                  <persName ref="#ps:FlorenceHardy">Miss Dugdale</persName> are here ministering to
               my wants: I don't know what I should do without them, &amp; I am sorry to say that
               just now <persName ref="#ps:FlorenceHardy">Florence</persName>
               <pb n="5" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3135_5.jpg"/> has a bad cold. I want her to stay in bed,
               but cannot get her to. I do not see many people. <persName ref="#ps:MrsSheridan">Mrs
                  Sheridan</persName> says she is coming, but she has not come. <persName
                  ref="#ps:BirdieIlchester">Lady Ilchester</persName> is at <placeName
                  ref="#pl:MelburyHouse">Melbury</placeName>, &amp; tells me she will be there if
               all's well till June. <persName ref="#ps:MargotAsquith">Mrs Asquith</persName> tells
               me she is ill, &amp; going away — not for a "rest cure" — she is too weak for that
               she says. <add place="above" rend="^">I am sorry for her</add>. <persName
                  ref="#ps:HubertvonHerkomer">Sir H. Herkomer</persName> is doing ^films of <ref
                  target="#bib:Hardy1874_FarFromTheMaddingCrowd">"Far from the Madding Crowd,"</ref>
               for the picture palaces: young Herkomer came here a few days ago to get local colour,
                  <pb n="6" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3135_6.jpg"/> &amp; has photographed the <hi
                  rend="underline">real</hi> jug used in the malt-house.</p>
            <p>There: that is about all the social &amp; artistic intelligence I can think of — a
               poor supply. One thing more: did you see my letter
               <!-- we could add a target in to the letter mentioned <ref target="https://www.fold3.com/document/295339266/">my letter</ref> -->
               in the <orgName type="newspaper" ref="#org-TheTimes">Times</orgName> about performing
               animals? You may not have done so, &amp; I send it on. But the words "Performing
               Animals" do not clearly indicate the matter: what I object to most are performances
                  <hi rend="underline">with</hi> animals — ^<add place="above">in which they are
                  passive</add> — e.g. bringing live canaries, rabbits, pigeons, &amp;c. out of the
               sleeve or handkerchief. Every spectator can see that the wretched creature is in the
               greatest misery, &amp; I <pb n="7" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3135_7.jpg"/> believe that a
               great many are "used" in these tricks — that is, tortured to death.</p>

            <p>I wonder when I shall see you. Not very soon I suppose; and you have many interests
               outside my life.</p>

            <closer>
               <salute>Your affectionate friend</salute>
