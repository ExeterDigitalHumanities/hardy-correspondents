               <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I have just read "<ref target="#bib:Hardy1891_Tess">Tess of the D'Urbervilles</ref>"
               with great interest. Whether the plot is founded on fact I know not but I happen to
               know an almost parallel case up to a certain point.</p>

            <pb n="2" facs="uoedh_hl_h.4597_2.jpg"/>

            <p>A child barely sixteen was taken advantage of as was <persName
                  ref="#ps:TessDurbeyfield">Tess</persName> with the same result.</p>

            <p>She subsequently became acquainted with a most worthy man and between them a real
               affection such as one would imagine nothing could sever ended in their marriage.</p>

            <pb n="3" facs="uoedh_hl_h.4597_3.jpg"/>

            <p>The incidents are the same. The girl often essayed to tell her lover what had
               happened <del><unclear>to</unclear></del> in her early days but without success as he
               always stopped her.</p>

            <p>They were married – the mutual confession was made precisely as between <persName
                  ref="#ps:AngelClare">Angel</persName> &amp; <persName ref="#ps:TessDurbeyfield"
                  >Tess</persName> and exactly the same result ensued.</p>

            <p>The man left his wife to rejoin his appoint­ <pb n="4" facs="uoedh_hl_h.4597_4.jpg"/>
               ment in <placeName ref="#pl:India">India</placeName> and died of cholera within a
               year but before he left <placeName ref="#pl:England">England</placeName> he gave his
               parents some plausible excuse for leaving his wife and arranged that she should
               receive through them a monthly allowance telling her what he had done &amp; that all
               letters between them should pass through the same channel. They corres­ <pb n="5"
                  facs="uoedh_hl_h.4597_5.jpg"/> ponded regularly for some time till some
               interfering busy-body a so-called "friend" of the family raked up the girl's history
               and told it to the man's parents who forthwith took upon themselves to stop the
               allowance and suppress all communication between the pair. The poor girl, <pb n="6"
                  facs="uoedh_hl_h.4597_6.jpg"/> now twenty, the same age as <persName
                  ref="#ps:TessDurbeyfield">Tess</persName>, as honest and as true in her devotion
               to her husband, deserted, as she thought, by him and his parents entered into
               domestic service where her story by some unaccountable means appears to have become
               known resulting in her being summarily <pb n="7" facs="uoedh_hl_h.4597_7.jpg"/>
               turned out of the house. Since then no trace of the unfortunate girl has been
               discovered.</p>


            <p>It was not till the husband's death that all the facts became known. Among his papers
               was one relating all that had happened describing his intense affection for his wife
               and the remorse which came home to him when his letters were <pb n="8"
                  facs="uoedh_hl_h.4597_8.jpg"/> unanswered and the allowance remained
               unclaimed.</p>


            <p>The state of mind of the man's parents for their share in the unhappy business for
               which they can never forgive themselves can well be imagined. The only excuse I have
               heard made for them is that they were actuated by a strict sense of morality <pb
                  n="9" facs="uoedh_hl_h.4597_9.jpg"/> but what is that morality which brings about
               such misery!</p>
