               <salute>Dear <persName ref="#ps:TH">Thomas Hardy</persName>,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Why did you write "<ref target="#bib:Hardy1891_Tess">Tess of the
               D'Urbervilles</ref>"? I wake up at night, screaming against the injustice of it, and
               I cannot rid it from my thoughts. It is the most haunting tragedy I have ever
               experienced.</p>

            <p>Is it necessary to add sorrow to an already overburdened world, even in the form of a
               novel? Or perhaps you have known a person, or persons, who have undergone these
               experiences, and you wished to proclaim the injustice that had been done to them.</p>

            <p>Is it the fate of some people to go through life, utterly alone, although longing and
               yearning for true <pb n="2" facs="uoedh_hl_h.4611_2.jpg"/> companionship and never
               finding it? Then suppose there is no life after death? Where does justice come in?
               Where are the long years of loneliness and unrelieved pain, and impositions upon
               innocence and helplessness made up for?</p>

            <p>What hope is there for <persName ref="#ps:TessDurbeyfield">Tess</persName>, or
                  <persName ref="#ps:AngelClare">Clare</persName>, or even <persName
                  ref="#ps:AlecDurberville">D'Urberville</persName>, or those who have suffered as
               they? Telling about it may prevent others from falling into snares of folly and
               ignorance and misunderstanding, but little good will the telling of it do <persName
                  ref="#ps:TessDurbeyfield">Tess</persName> in finding what she sought for in vain.
               And why the exquisite touch of torturing her and <persName ref="#ps:AngelClare">
                  Clare</persName>
               <subst><del>with</del>
                  <add place="above">by giving them</add></subst> the happiness they sought where it
               was too late for them to hold it? What <pb n="3" facs="uoedh_hl_h.4611_3.jpg"
                  xml:id="h4611a" corresp="#m01"/>
               <milestone xml:id="m03" unit="section"/> is behind the Fate that controls these
               things? What is the ultimate answer?</p>

            <p>You are an artist and can see into the depths of sorrow and feel it, and can also
               describe what you see and feel. What <del rend="crosshatch">what</del> of those who
               are not artists, <del rend="strikethrough">on</del> or only half,-artists, <del
                  rend="strikethrough">and</del> who also see &amp; feel sorrow as clearly as you,
               but have not the gift of raising a voice in protest? They can only suffer and say
               nothing. What hope do you offer them, or do you offer them any?</p>

            <p>What is there to live for? Must we accept an inevitable Fate, which doles happiness
               to some and sorrow to others? Have you any vision of what lies behind it all, or
               beyond?</p>

            <p>You are old, and I am young, and <pb n="4" facs="uoedh_hl_h.4611_4.jpg"/> you have
               plumbed the depths of men's hearts. Can you not give me a notion of what the answers
               to my questions are, before you come to the place where you know the true answers,
               but cannot tell them? My life should be happy, considering its circumstances, but
               sometimes I feel as if an awful chasm were opening at my feet, and there below only
               cries of unrequited pain, unredeemed injustice, are heard. It seems that the only
               life left after death were sorrow.</p>

            <p>There are some who would say that all pain was not as bad as it seems. But I cannot
               make fine distinctions. The tragical facts of life, are facts, and the fund of human
                  <milestone xml:id="m01" unit="section"/>
               <pb n="5" facs="uoedh_hl_h.4611_5.jpg"/>
               <milestone xml:id="m04" unit="section"/> happiness will not be increased until these
               facts are altered. In the meantime â€“ what? And will they ever be altered? People do
               commit unremediable folly, and do die in hopelessness, even as <persName
                  ref="#ps:TessDurbeyfield">Tess</persName> died. Every day, appalling injustice is
               done, which is not ameliorated in any degree by the fact that justice and mercy are
               also sometimes done. What of those whose lives have been ruined? Why is pain? Why is
               injustice? Are they fundamental and ultimate defects in the scheme of things, that
               will never be altered, but must be borne? If this is an answer, then it were better
               not to live, if by dying we could escape these <del rend="strikethrough">facts</del>
               defects.</p>

            <pb n="6" facs="uoedh_hl_h.4611_6.jpg"/>

            <p>These questions sometimes almost drive me mad, but that does not bring an answer.</p>

            <p>I write this in the hope that perhaps you can help me, even a little,</p>
