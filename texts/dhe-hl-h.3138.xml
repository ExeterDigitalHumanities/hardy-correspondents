               <salute>My dear friend:</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>What a strange thing. This morning when I was dressing it flashed into my mind that I
               had been going to write to you for several days, &amp; that I would do it this very
               day: when lo, there was a letter from you. This has happened I think once or twice
               before in our correspondence. Still I suppose I must knock the <pb n="2"
                  facs="uoedh_hl_h.3138_2.jpg"/> romance out of it &amp; say it was only a
               coincidence.</p>

            <p> We intend to be in <placeName ref="#pl:London">London</placeName> from Wednesday to
               Saturday next week, &amp; we shall I believe be staying at <persName
                  ref="#ps:SusanJeune">Lady St. Helier</persName>'s. I was in hopes you were at
                  <placeName ref="#pl:StratfordPlace">Stratford Place</placeName>. I fear there will
               not be time to run down to you, in the event of <del>them</del> her having arranged
               things to do; but I don't know. I am thinking we may be able, however, to go to <pb
                  n="3" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3138_3.jpg"/>
               <placeName ref="#pl:London">London</placeName> again for a day or two during July, in
               which case we will make a point of visiting your little orchard. Meanwhile cannot you
               come here for a week-end or week-middle, just as you choose. I really think you ought
               to honour <placeName ref="#pl:MaxGate">Max Gate</placeName> by sleeping in it just
               once at any rate. <persName ref="#ps:FlorenceHardy">F</persName>. will write to you
               about this.</p>

            <p>The vein, or veins, do not trouble me, unless I walk too far. How kind of you to bear
               in mind that <pb n="4" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3138_4.jpg"/> inconvenience of mine. I think
               bicycling was the original cause. </p>


            <p>As you ask what I am doing in poetry I am sending the <name type="periodical"
                  >Fortnightly</name> for May, containing the last thing I published. I have a lot
               of loose poems in <choice><abbr>MS.</abbr>
                  <expan>manuscript</expan></choice> which I must, I suppose, collect into a volume.
               Of course I shall send you a copy, whenever it comes out.</p>

            <p>We are going on very quietly. <persName ref="#ps:FlorenceHardy">Florence</persName>
               works at flower-gardening â€” rather too hard, I think; but she is quite devoted to it.
               About <pb n="5" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3138_5.jpg"/> three weeks ago we motored to
                  <placeName ref="#pl:Plymouth">Plymouth</placeName>, partly because I wanted to
               clear up a mystery as to the Gifford vault there. We came back over <placeName
                  ref="#pl:Dartmoor">Dartmoor</placeName>. It was cold, &amp; the gradients were
               high, but the views beautiful.</p>

            <p>I, too, have felt uneasy about that physiological Laboratory. But I suppose one must
               take the word of the vivisectors as honest when they assure us that they never
               torture animals. Altogether the world is <pb n="6" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3138_6.jpg"/>
               such a bungled institution from a humane point of view that a grief more or less
               hardly counts. Wishing one had never come into it or shared in its degrading
               organizations is but a selfish thought, as others would have been here just the same.
               But this sounds gloomy to you I know; &amp; I am after all not without hope of much
               amelioration.</p>
