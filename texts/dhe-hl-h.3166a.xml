            <p>I have delayed my reply to your kind letter a few days, to bring it into
               Christmastide, when I know you like to receive missives, even of such a dull
               character as mine is likely to be I fear. Thank you for your inquiries: we have
               recovered &amp; are now as well as two aged people can hope to be (<persName
                  ref="#ps:FlorenceHardy"><choice><abbr>F.</abbr>
                     <expan>Florence</expan></choice></persName> will thank me for putting it this
               way!) <milestone xml:id="m01" unit="section"/>I fancy from the brightness of your
               letter that you are already profiting <pb n="2" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3166a_2.jpg"/> from
               the country air, even though you must miss the people you are able to see in
                  <placeName ref="#pl:London">London</placeName>. We are in a drizzle here today,
               though the weather has on the whole been good. </p>

            <p><placeName ref="#pl:BognorRegis">Bognor</placeName> I seem to know quite well from
               friends, though I have never actually set foot in it – which is very stupid, as I
               have been to <placeName ref="#pl:Chichester"> Chichester</placeName>, <placeName
                  ref="#pl:Worthing">Worthing</placeName>, &amp; all about there several times. The
               young architect who was the original of <persName ref="#ps:StephenSmith">Stephen
                  Smith</persName> in "<ref target="#bib:Hardy1873_PairOfBlueEyes">A Pair of Blue

                  ref="#pl:BognorRegis">Bognor</placeName> &amp; to go there with his family. <pb
                  n="3" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3166a_3.jpg"/> "<placeName ref="#pl:BlakesCottage">Blake’s

               interesting: but which Blake does it mean? Since writing this question I have
               discovered that it means <persName ref="#ps:WilliamBlake">Blake</persName> the poet.
                  <persName ref="#ps:WilliamHayley">Hayley</persName> was a poetaster, <persName
                  ref="#ps:WilliamBlake">Blake</persName>’s friend, &amp; was ridiculed by <persName
                  ref="#ps:GeorgeByron">Byron</persName> in "English Bards." I don’t know what
               "steyne" means, unless it is a paved way. </p>

            <p>I have read very little on the Irish situation lately: it was so worrying that I had
               to give it up. "Irish Free State" does, as you say, sound unromantic. The Ireland
               Free State, or Irish Freeland would perhaps be less so.</p>

            <p><persName ref="#ps:WalterdelaMare">Walter de la Mare</persName> has sent us his new
               poems. They are rather too obscure, I think: but many of them have his own peculiar
               beauty in them when you get to the bottom <pb n="4" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3166a_4.jpg"/>
               of their meaning. </p>

            <p>We were at our neighbours' the <persName ref="#ps:CecilHanbury">Hanburys</persName>
               at <placeName ref="#pl:KingstonMaurward">Kingston Maurward</placeName> yesterday
               afternoon. Her father, <persName ref="#ps:JohnSymonsJeune">Mr
               Symons-Jeune</persName>, whom you met, is coming <add place="above">to them</add> to
               stay over Christmas, so we shall see him. A very mild little poem of mine appears in
               the <choice><abbr>Dec.</abbr><expan>December</expan></choice>
               <orgName type="periodical" ref="#ps:Fortnightly">Fortnightly</orgName>, and to save
               trouble I send a <add place="above">spare</add> proof of it instead of the heavy
               magazine. I have also another – a longer one – in the Dec. <orgName type="newspaper"
                  ref="#ps:LondonMercury">London Mercury</orgName>. It would, I think, please you
               more than this trifling one, but I have neither proof nor magazine. The title is <ref
                  target="#bib:Hardy1921_Voices">"Voices from things growing (in a
                  churchyard)"</ref>.</p>


            <p>Now I come to wishing you a happy Xmas &amp; New Year: as also does <persName
