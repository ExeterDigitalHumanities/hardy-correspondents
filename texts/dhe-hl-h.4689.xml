               <salute>My dear Sir</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I am glad to see that you have taken up the cause of the horses.
                     It<del><unclear>s</unclear></del> has always seemed to me that the use of
               horses in war is a thing that cannot long be maintained in view of the growing
               sympathy with the dumb animals – one of the best fruits of modern civilization. It is
               no whit less barbarous than their use in bull-fights, a thing con­demned by all
               persons of right feeling &amp; <del><gap reason="deleted"/></del> only supported by
               those whom every person of right feeling recognises to be modern savages. Of course,
               as you say, the poor brutes do not know what they die for, as it is the privilege of
               the soldier to know.</p>
            <!--possible paragraph break here-->

            <p>Numbers of shallow-minded people <subst><del><unclear>w</unclear></del><add
                     place="above">-</add></subst> people too who love horses – would say that <subst>
                  <del>they</del>
                  <add place="above">the horses</add>
               </subst> enjoy a charge. They enjoy <del rend="scribble"
               >it</del><!--change rend desc.?--> of course the excitement &amp; the rivalry in the
               race up to the moment when they are shot, but they don't enjoy their death,
               agony.</p>

            <p>I admire the <persName ref="#ps:NicholasII">Czar</persName>, but I should have
               admired him more if he had suggested the abolition of cavalry. I scarcely suppose <pb
                  n="2" facs="uoedh_hl_h.4689_2.jpg"/> that this reform is in the <hi
                  rend="underline">near</hi> future; but, as you say, the development of the
               mechanism of war may enforce it, before a senti­ment, which may seem now to many
               maudlin, but which <hi rend="underline">must</hi> continue to grow, enforces it. This
               sentiment has still in antagonism to it the sentiment of the middle ages which
               descends to us <subst><del>o</del><add place="superimposed">w</add></subst>ith the
               words "knight" &amp; chivalrous; it has in antagonism to it the sentiment created by
               the glorious exploits of caval­ry in war. <del>This latter</del>These antagonistic
               sentiments should be tempered by the reflection that the names of the heroic <add
                  place="above">war-</add> horses do not <add place="above">usually</add> survive
               like the names of renowned racers, whose success puts money in the pockets of their
               owners &amp; backers. How few do survive – <del><unclear reason="illegible"
                     >Buce's</unclear></del> Achilles' horses &amp; Bucephalus &amp; Brigliador
               &amp; Marbot's Lisette. So that even if the horses have some obscure sense of
               sacrifice for fame, this is not satisfied. As a fact I think they have none &amp; are
               simply butchered But <subst>
                  <del>crack</del>
                  <add place="above">to propose</add>
               </subst> to disestablish crack cavalry regiments is still beyond the daring of the
                  <persName ref="#ps:NicholasII">Czar</persName></p>
