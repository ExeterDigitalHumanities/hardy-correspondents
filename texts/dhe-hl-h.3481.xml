               <salute>My dear Sir</salute>
            </opener>

            <p> Thank you for your letter and kind offer to help me with sketches. I will endeavour
               to improve on <persName ref="#ps:EustaciaVye">Eustacia</persName> next time she makes
               her appearance.</p>

            <p>I quite agree with you about the <del>necessity</del>
               <add place="above">desirability</add> of the artist &amp; author being in constant
               communication – or, still better, personal intercourse.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3481_2.jpg"/>
            <p>The thing might be well &amp; thoroughly done then, which is not the case in
               practice.</p>


            <p>The novel of the day is, practically, not illustrated but embellished with a dozen
               drawings having some sort of connection with the story.</p>

            <p> However, I do not suppose that I shall improve all this; under the circumstances it
               is inevitable: </p>

            <p>But I do hope in the case of <pb n="3" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3481_3.jpg"/> the <ref
                  target="#bib:Hardy1878_Native">'Return of the Native'</ref> to supply some
               drawings of a strength and character in keeping with the strength and character of
               the story.</p>

            <p>Although I believe that nobody but the author himself could really <hi
                  rend="underline">illustrate</hi> a story (since no two people ever picture a
               described scene alike) still I think that some drawings certainly form an additional
               attraction to the public; and I can remember several cases where the story was much
               more vividly <pb n="4" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3481_4.jpg"/> imprinted in my mind &amp;
               fancy, and stamped in my memory, by its illustrations.</p>

            <p>I am now at work on the <ref
                  target="http://www.victorianweb.org/art/illustration/hopkins/5.html">May
                  drawing</ref>. I have chosen the incident in the Party Scene where <persName
                  ref="#ps:GrandferCantle">Grandfer Cantle</persName> asks to be looked over with
               the view of finding an improvement in his personal appearance. </p>

            <p>I avoided introducing <persName ref="#ps:EustaciaVye">Eustacia</persName> as in
               consequence of her disguise I believed it would be unwise.</p>

            <p>But there is room on one side <pb n="5" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3481_5.jpg"/> to introduce a
               Mummer or two among the group. The Mumming Costume you sketched I presume was
                  <persName ref="#ps:EustaciaVye">Eustacia</persName>'s. Would not some of the less
               important of them have a less complete costume. I thought one might have no more than
               his best smock adorned with many ribbons, a plume &amp; a sword.</p>

            <p>But I will wait to finish the drawing till I hear from you.</p>

            <p>This picture introduces <persName ref="#ps:ClymYeobright">Clym</persName>
               conspicuously, – I can only hope you will like him.</p>

               <salute>Yours very truly</salute>
