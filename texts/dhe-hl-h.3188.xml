            <p>What a blessing it has been to have had really <hi rend="underline">no</hi> winter!
               However I hope you are taking care of yourself, as so many people seem to have colds
               and coughs, possibly because they are rather imprudent in this lovely early spring.
               –</p>

            <p>I saw some of your <pb n="2" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3188_2.jpg"/>
               <persName ref="#ps:JohnKeats">Keats</persName> verses quoted, &amp; I must eventually
               buy the book, but at this moment I am in a hard-up condition! –</p>

            <p>I went to hear <persName ref="#ps:ErnestdeSelincourt">Prof de Selincourt</persName>'s
               excellent lecture on <persName ref="#ps:JohnKeats">Keats</persName> at the <placeName
                  ref="#pl:BurlingtonHouse">Burlington House</placeName> gathering - <persName
                  ref="#ps:MrMacKail">Mr MacKail</persName> also spoke very well, but disagreed with
                  <persName ref="#ps:ErnestdeSelincourt">Prof. de S</persName>'s point of view that
                  <persName ref="#ps:JohnKeats">Keats</persName> might have done <hi
                  rend="underline">greater</hi> work <pb n="3" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3188_3.jpg"/> had he
               lived longer –. I suppose <hi rend="underline">you</hi> would say that in some of it,
               he had really attained <hi rend="underline">perfection</hi> –?</p>

            <p>I am very sorry that our old friend <persName ref="#ps:FrederickWedmore">Sir
                  Frederick Wedmore</persName> has gone. But the last year or so of his life must
               have been most painful both for him &amp; his family -</p>

            <p>I think you <choice><abbr>w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>.</abbr></choice> find much
               to admire in his "<name type="poem">Collapse of the Penitent</name>" &amp; some of
               his short stories? –</p>

            <p><persName ref="#ps:BirdieIlchester">Birdie I.</persName> and <persName
                  ref="#ps:MaryFox-Strangways">Mary</persName>
               <!--Assumed this is Mary Ilchester-->came to luncheon here a day or 2 ago, &amp; we
               talked of you. <pb n="4" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3188_4.jpg"/> They were both looking so
               well (&amp; <hi rend="underline">good</hi>-looking!) Of course, <persName
                  ref="#ps:BirdieIlchester">B.</persName> is dreadfully sad at leaving <placeName
                  ref="#pl:MelburyHouse">Melbury</placeName>. I own I can't at all understand why
               they could not <add place="above">still</add> live in part of the house, as they
               appear to have been doing? –</p>

            <p>I hope <persName ref="#ps:FlorenceHardy">F.</persName> &amp; Wessex are well? When is
                  <persName ref="#ps:FlorenceHardy">F.</persName> coming to <placeName
                  ref="#pl:London">London</placeName> again? –</p>

            <p>I have two dogs now who wanted to be given happy homes. The elder one, an Airedale,
               is a very pathetic creature. – His nerves seem to have been <pb n="5"
