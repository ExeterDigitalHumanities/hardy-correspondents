               <salute>My dear friend:</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I am writing again to you to answer some points on which you say you are curious (as
               indeed I should have guessed you were), &amp; also because your letter was so kind as
               to make me wish to write.</p>

            <p> It has been a great delight to me all through that you know <persName
                  ref="#ps:FlorenceHardy">Florence</persName> quite well, &amp; like her. As you say
               she is very sympathetic — so much so that her own health <pb n="2"
                  facs="uoedh_hl_h.3137_2.jpg"/> is largely dependent upon the happiness or
               otherwise of her friends. One thing you may be sure of — her intense love &amp;
               admiration of yourself: she often settles points by saying or thinking what <hi
                  rend="underline">you</hi> would do in the circumstances: assuming invariably that
               that is absolutely the right thing.</p>

            <p> I rather am surprised that <hi rend="underline">you</hi> were surprised at the step
               we have taken — such a course seeming an obvious one to me, <pb n="3"
                  facs="uoedh_hl_h.3137_3.jpg"/> being as I was so lonely &amp; helpless. I think I
               told you in my last letter that I am very glad she knew <persName ref="#ps:EmmaHardy"
                  >Emma</persName> well, &amp; was liked by her even during her latter years, when
               her mind was a little unhinged at times, &amp; she showed unreasonable dislikes. I
               wonder if it will surprise you when I say that according to my own experience a
               second marriage does not, or need not, obliterate an old affection, though it is
               generally assumed that the first wife is entirely forgotten in such cases.</p>

            <pb n="4" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3137_4.jpg"/>
            <p>We are going to <placeName ref="#pl:London">London</placeName> next week, but only
               for a day or two. I will let you know when we go up later (if we do) for a longer
               stay, so that we may contrive to see you somehow.</p>


            <p>Even now I have not answered your question on what people wrote about our marriage.
               Well: they all say they foresaw it, except one besides yourself — I forget who. Of
               course they <hi rend="underline">might</hi> say so to show their penetration or claim
               it. But perhaps they really did.</p>

            <closer>
               <salute>With all affection I am,</salute>
               <salute>Your sincere friend</salute>

               <signed>Tho. H.</signed>
            </closer>
