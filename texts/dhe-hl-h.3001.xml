            <p>You never write to me now a days, it is my duty nevertheless to inform you of my next
               year's whereabouts. I am going to <placeName ref="#pl:Denchworth"><hi
                     rend="underline">Denchworth</hi></placeName> near <placeName ref="#pl:Wantage"
                  >Wantage</placeName>. The salary is £40 a year, with a garden &amp; a house partly
               furnished. I have to play the Organ in Church, I, on account of this wanted, of
               course, to give it up &amp; <persName ref="#ps:MrRawlins">M<hi rend="superscript"
                     >r</hi> Rawlins</persName>, (the clergyman) was informed of it but he wrote to
               say he would pay a little for me <pb n="2" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3001_2.jpg"/> to learn *
               &amp; also give me a little time to practice when there, before playing in Church.
                  <persName ref="#ps:KateHardy">Katie</persName><del rend="strikethrough">s</del> is
               going with <unclear>me</unclear> &amp; Mother is going to stay with
                  <unclear>me</unclear> for a few weeks when I go first. </p>

            <p>It is a few miles from <placeName ref="#pl:Wantage">Wantage</placeName> – a school of
               35 children &amp; about – I should imagine, 15 miles from <placeName ref="#pl:Oxford"
                  >Oxford</placeName>. I shall be a long way from home – nearly 200 miles. They all
               want me to go there, because the people there are reputedto be extremely kind. When I
               am settled down</p>

            <p>
               <note rend="pencil" hand="#ps:TH">* i.e., the organ touch (she had played the piano
                  for many years)</note>

               <unclear>far off as de</unclear>
               <gap extent="several lines" reason="tear"/> longed for a place near the sea but I was
               obliged to give it up. We have only one more week to study &amp; then my duty as a
               pupil, I suppose, will have gone for me. I have bought the Salisbury Sanctus Book
               &amp; <unclear>Tunes</unclear> Book <add place="above">I want a Chant Book too</add>
               but I can't afford it so you must send, to <placeName ref="#pl:HigherBockhampton"
                  >Bock hampton</placeName>, yours, that I may have <pb n="4"
                  facs="uoedh_hl_h.3001_4.jpg"/> it in my holidays – as soon as I get home. <gap
                  extent="several lines" reason="tear"/>
            </p>

            <p>I read an account of the closing of the Exhibtion; my curiosity is excited to know
               how it looks &amp; if many frequent the far famed spot now? In my mind's eye I see
               all the <add place="above"><unclear>articles</unclear></add> disarranged, the floor
               dirty &amp; men standing about &amp; buying the things. Does <persName
                  ref="#ps:WilliamShakespeare">Shakespere</persName> still <unclear>sit</unclear>
               there? Write &amp; tell me. It is just four o'clock &amp; a dull evening. I am
                  thin<del>g</del>king <pb n="5" facs="uoedh_hl_h.3001_5.jpg"/> that you have all
               your lights burning in <placeName ref="#pl:London">London</placeName> at this time –
               we have but just the gas burner lighted. </p>
