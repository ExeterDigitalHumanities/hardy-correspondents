               <salute>Dear Master Hardy.</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>This is not where I really live, but the place whereat our regiment is billeted in
               training for the Front - myself being a private temporally in the Tenth Middlesex
               during this awful, though fortunately only transitory time.</p>

            <p>I have recently read <ref target="#bib:Hardy1891_Tess">Tess of the
                  d'Urbervilles</ref> and while I am still in <pb n="2" facs="uoedh_hl_h.4609_2.jpg"
               /> the <unclear>way</unclear>, wish to thank you. I am in rather a difficult
               position, for as you clearly show in your writings, you do not care what any man
               thinks of your books. The expression of thanks to you, must be similar to that
               tendered to a great surgeon by a patient, whose life he has saved under the influence
               of anaesthetics.</p>

            <p>I can only ask you to believe in the sincerity of my appreciation.</p>

            <pb n="3" facs="uoedh_hl_h.4609_3.jpg"/>



            <p>I know the country well. My grandfather - <persName ref="#ps:JohnBeard">Master John
                  Beard</persName> was master at the <placeName ref="#pl:Bridport">Port
                  Bredy</placeName> National Schools from about 1850 until 1894 and still continued
               to live in that lovely little town until his death in 1910. With him I spent my
               holidays walking through the Matchless <placeName ref="#pl:MarshwoodVale">Vale of
                  Marshwood</placeName> and roaming over <placeName ref="#pl:PilsdonPen">Pilsdon
                  Pen</placeName> and <placeName ref="#pl:LewesdonHill"> Lewesdon
               Hill</placeName>.</p>

            <p>Then again the story is modern, within the period of railways. There <pb n="4"
                  facs="uoedh_hl_h.4609_4.jpg"/> is no "wrapping up" in an age of which we know
               nothing. Not that I wish to depreciate "mystery." That is the lovely charm of Gothic
               Architecture.</p>

            <p>I have never read a story which subdued and impressed me so much. Not even "Hereward
               the Wake" or "The Cloister and The Hearth" in which, in the legend of "The Cross in
               Hand" there is a similarity. – I went out into the night air to meditate upon the
               tragedy under the stars <pb n="5" facs="uoedh_hl_h.4609_5.jpg"/> I could not help
               wondering how you being a man could so well imagine the thoughts of an outraged pure
               woman. Could all that agony be borne by one poor girl? Surely an English Court of Law
               would not have condemned her to death considering the evidence which would have been
               brought forward at the trial by <persName ref="#ps:AngelClare">Angel Clare</persName>
               and the landlady? I felt that the false d'Urberville deserved <pb n="6"
                  facs="uoedh_hl_h.4609_6.jpg"/> to die from some horrible lingering disease. I have
               little sympathy for <persName ref="#ps:AngelClare">Angel Clare</persName> — how about
               his sin of which he says no more and over which <persName ref="#ps:TessDurbeyfield"
                  >Tess</persName> seems to pass? It is a kind of poetical justice that <persName
                  ref="#ps:TessDurbeyfield">Tess</persName> refused to see him longer. He spoke the
               truth when he remarked, previous to his emigration to <placeName ref="#pl:Brazil"
                  >Brazil</placeName>
               <q>
                  <choice>
                     <sic>"that it would break the continuity of his life."</sic>
                     <corr>"But, my dear Mercy, it snaps the continuity of existence."</corr>
                  </choice>
               </q>
            </p>
            <!--use <corr> to write correct phrasing? Need to check authoritative version of text-->

            <p>After spending seven or eight years in and out <pb n="7" facs="uoedh_hl_h.4609_7.jpg"
               /> an architect's and church decorator's office, I went to <placeName
                  ref="#pl:Canada">Canada</placeName>, expecting to find work of that description
               but was disillusioned. I did some farming - amongst other things - but I did not find
               the rising at three in the morning so romantic as in "<ref
                  target="#bib:Hardy1891_Tess">Tess</ref>"</p>

            <p>It is one thing to gaze down upon a dairy pasture and listen to the lowing of cattle
               in the distance, and another thing to have them bellowing underneath your bedroom
               window <pb n="8" facs="uoedh_hl_h.4609_8.jpg"/> at three A. M.</p>

            <p>I am commencing "<ref target="#bib:Hardy1878_Native">The Return of the Native</ref>"
               which I have heard described as a tragedy of "temperament and environment." I
               understand this first appeared in 1878 and <ref target="#bib:Hardy1891_Tess"
                  >Tess</ref> in 1891.</p>
